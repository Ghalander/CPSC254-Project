We will be doing the _ERN stack! Still don't know what will be the first letter yet.

Express (this will be our communicator from front end to back end. typically called REST API)
React (this will be our javascript framework for the front end!)
Node (this will be the server that will be ran on the backend)

Only thing left to do is choose the database we will be using.
