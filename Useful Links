So you want to clone the repo to your local machine and create your origin and master remote points.
Then these will be the steps you'll on a normal bases.

1) git fetch origin master (this will take whatever was done from bitbucket repo and store it locally)
2) ** do code and stuffs **
3) git add . (makes it so all the files you've worked on will be ready for committing)
4) git commit -m "nice message" (replace nice message with whatever meaningful thing you did when you worked on the new files so that others know what was done)
5) git push origin master (this will push it to the remote bitbucket server)

This is all without doing checkouts and making a pull request.

Checkouts allow us to create different branches that we can work on so we don't change the "working" files.
A pull request will let us put the two branches (main and whatevs-branch) together and see if things don't break
